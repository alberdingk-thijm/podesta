//! ## Example
//!
//! ### Serializing and deserializing an Event
//! Uses serde_json
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate serde_json;
//! # extern crate podesta;
//! # fn main() {
//! use podesta::events;
//! let ev = events::Event {
//!     name: "Fire".to_string(),
//!     id: 1,
//!     desc: "%s has erupted into flames!".to_string(),
//!     chance: 3,
//!     effects: vec!("Kill_2".to_string(), "Dam_2".to_string()),
//! };
//! let se = serde_json::to_string(&ev).unwrap();
//! let de : events::Event = serde_json::from_str(&se).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!(de.id, ev.id)
//! # }
//! ```
