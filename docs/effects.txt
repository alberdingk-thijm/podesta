EFFECTS IN PODESTA
--------------------

Every event has one or more associated effects. These are essentially a
lower-level description of the results of an event being called. For instance,
an event like Fire should kill some percentage of the population and damage
a number of buildings. This can then be represented by a Kill effect and a
Damage effect.
Effects roll dice on behalf of events, and return a Request struct with the
results of those rolls and their interpretation. Requests are then stored by
the Event caller (the host building) until they can be read by the Manager.
At each step, the existing Request struct is overwritten and a new one is
created to detail the results of this turn's events.

Example

The Library building has a RareBook event which creates a new Item and stores
it in the building. The Item's value is variable and it may or may not be
magical, depending on the number of mages in the settlement.
When the RareBook event triggers, each effect of the event is activated. In
this case, RareBook has one effect, which is creating an item.
The Library then receives the return of the event trigger, which is a Request
for an Item of variable value and magical quality, and stores this information
in its Requests field.
When the manager performs the event update step, it can then examine each
building and check for requests. It accepts the RareBook event and then creates
the new Item, which it places in the Library.
