EVENTS IN SETTGEN
-----------------

Introduction:
Every new infrastructure element to a settlement allows a new event to take
place there. These events can be positive or negative, and with each timestep
a roll is made to see if an event took place.
Events can have several different effects, but typically modify how a
settlement will grow or develop. Every event is also logged in a settlement's
history.

Rolling Events:

At each timestep, settgen queries each quarter in the settlement for its
infrastructure and acquires an updated list of possible events.

Event Effects:
There are eight different event effects.

- Kill citizens (KILL)
- Damage buildings (DAMAGE)
- Slow growth and building (RIOT)
- Grow the settlement (GROW)
- Build more quickly (BUILD)
- Earn gold faster (GOLD) (NEW)
- Add a new notable (HERO)
- Add a new item (ITEM)

KILL effect:
When an event has a KILL effect, it has a risk of killing some of the
settlement's population, based on the intensity of the effect.
The KILL effect has three fields:
- dead: dice expr - the number of dead for the specified kill area.
- viralpt: int or null - an optional threshold; if the dead expression is greater
  than or equal to viralpt, an additional KILL effect is performed for the parent
  area.
- area: area expr - the target of the dead expression (Hero, Quarter, Sett);
  controls how the death toll is subtracted from the population.

DAMAGE effect:
When an event has a DAMAGE effect, it has a risk of damaging infrastructure in
the quarter or settlement as a whole, based on the intensity of the effect.
The DAMAGE effect has three fields:
- crumbled: dice expr - the damage taken by the area expression's building(s).
  Note: if a building is in progress, it is reset to -100 instead of adding damage.
- viralpt: int or null - an optional threshold; if the crumbled expression is
  greater than or equal to viralpt, an additional DAMAGE effect is performed for the
  parent area.
- area: area expr -  the target of the crumbled expression (Building, Quarter,
  Sett); controls how the crumbled damage is added to the building(s).

RIOT effect:
When an event has a RIOT effect, it has a risk of temporarily halting all
growth and building progress in the quarter or settlement as a whole, based
on the intensity of the effect.
The RIOT effect has three fields:
- steps: dice expr - the number of steps the effect will last.
- prod: float - the percent rate which is multiplied against the "tickers" (growth,
  build speed, gold gain) for the settlement and reduces them.
- area: area expr - the target of the riot (Quarter, Sett); controls the extent of
  the decrease.

GROW effect:
When an event has a GROW effect, it increases the growth rate of the quarter
or the entire settlement, based on the intensity of the effect.
The GROW effect has two fields:
- bonus: dice expr - the percent increase to the settlement's growth this step
- area: area expr - the target of the growth (Quarter, Sett); controls the extent
  of the increase.

BUILD effect:
When an event has a BUILD effect, it increases the build speed of the quarter
or the entire settlement, based on the intensity of the effect.
The BUILD effect has two fields:
- bonus: dice expr - the percent increase to the settlement's build speed this step
- area: area expr - the target of the build speed increase (Building, Quarter,
  Sett); controls the extent of the increase.

GOLD effect:
When an event has a GOLD effect, it increases the amount of gold earned by the
settlement per timestep, based on the intensity of the effect.
The GOLD effect has three fields:
- value: dice expr - the immediate gold payout on the first turn of the effect.
- bonus: float - the percent rate which is multiplied against gold gain for the
  settlement for the steps.
- steps: dice expr - the number of steps that the bonus is active.

HERO effect:
When an event has a HERO effect, it generates a new hero residing in the
quarter. The hero's level is based on the intensity of the effect.
The HERO effect has two fields:
- level: dice expr - the level of the generated hero
- classes: list of classes - the classes the effect can generate; each class has an
  equal chance of being selected by the event.

ITEM effect:
When an event has an ITEM effect, it generates a new item residing in the
quarter. The item's power is based on the intensity of the effect.
The ITEM effect has two fields:
- value: dice expr - the gold value the item could obtain if sold; while it is in
  the settlement, it generates 1% of this value each timestep.
- magical: float - the odds that the item is revealed to be magical; while it is in
  the settlement, it generates 5% of its value each timestep.
